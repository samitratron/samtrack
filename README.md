![alt tag](https://github.com/samitratron/samtrack/blob/master/images/samtrack_launch_page.png)


Overview :
==========
SaMTrack stands for Software Activities Management & Tracker . This is very similar to Microsoft Project  but a simplified version and with important functionalities. Here we can set goals and milestones. To achieve these goals activities can be created. These activities can be broken down into tasks and several users can work on this task in a shared basis or independelty.

The way SaMTrack is designed so that it is hierachial based. A manager/project manager can view and assign tasks/activities to his/her team. Even the roll up happens in a similar fashion.

In SaMTrack we can see workload distribution at team level and also view Gantt chart.

SaMTrack also allows users to search for availability of resources within an organization having specific skillset and competency.
